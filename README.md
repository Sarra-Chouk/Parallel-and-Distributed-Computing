## **Sequential Version Conclusions**

#### `Genetic Algorithm Explanation:`
The script **genetic_algorithm_trial.py** implements a Genetic Algorithm to optimize a delivery route, minimizing the total travel distance. The algorithm follows these steps:

`1. Initialization:`
- Loads a distance matrix representing travel costs between locations.
- Defines key parameters such as population size, mutation rate, number of generations, and stagnation limits.

`2. Population Generation:`
- Creates an initial population of routes, ensuring uniqueness and validity.

`3. Evolution Process:`
- **Fitness Evaluation:** Computes the fitness of each route (fitness is defines as the shortest route).

- **Stagnation Handling:** If no improvement is observed for 5 consecutive generations, a new population is generated while keeping the best solution.

- **Selection:** Uses a tournament selection mechanism to pick individuals for reproduction.

- **Crossover & Mutation:** Performs order crossover and mutation to create new routes while balancing exploitation and exploration.

- **Replacement:** The worst-performing routes are replaced with new offspring.

`4. Final Selection:`
- Identifies the best route in the final population and prints the best total travel distance.

#### `Performance Analysis:`

**Best total distance:** 1224.0

**Execution time:** 25.02 seconds

## **Parallel Version Conclusions**

#### `Parallelization Approach:`
The parallel implementation divides the **population** into multiple **chunks** and processes them concurrently using **multiprocessing**. Each chunk evolves independently using a Genetic Algorithm. 

The key parallelized parts are:

`1. Population Chunking:`
- The full population of 10,000 routes is split into 24 chunks distributed across CPU cores.

`2. Parallel Evolution of Chunks:`
- Each chunk is processed independently using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing Pool, running the **`evolve_chunk()`** function concurrently. The implementation uses **`starmap_async()`**, allowing for asynchronous execution of the function across multiple processes.

`3. Independent Selection, Crossover, and Mutation:`
- Each chunk undergoes fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation separately, reducing computational bottlenecks.

`4. Final Selection of the Best Solution:`
- After processing all chunks, the best route is selected from the pool of optimized solutions.

#### `Performance Metrics:`

**Best total distance:** 1380

**Sequential execution time:** 25.02 seconds

**Parallel execution time:** 4.36 seconds

**Speedup:** 5.73

**Efficiency:** 0.96
