"""
A* Explorer module (no visualization).

This module implements the A* algorithm to find a path from the mazeâ€™s
start position to the goal using Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
It returns a tuple containing the solution path (list of cell coordinates)
and the total time taken to compute the solution.
